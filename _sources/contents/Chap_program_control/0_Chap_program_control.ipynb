    "Conditional compilation can be performed with conventional #ifdef directives in C, C++, and Fortran, and additionally with OpenMP sentinel (__!$__) in Fortran.  The __if__ clause on some directives can direct the runtime to ignore or alter the behavior of the construct. Of course, the base-language __if__ statements can be used to control the execution of stand-alone directives (such as __flush__, __barrier__, __taskwait__,  and  __taskyield__). However, the directives must appear in a block structure, and not as a substatement. The __metadirective__ and __declare__ __variant__ directives provide conditional  selection of directives and routines for compilation (and use), respectively. The __assume__ and __requires__ directives provide invariants for optimizing compilation, and essential features for compilation  and correct execution, respectively."

The __cancel__ construct is activated by the first encountering thread,  and it continues execution at the end of the named region.
