    "In CASE 1, a lambda expression is defined inside a __target__ construct that implicitly maps the structure \textit{s}. Inside the construct, the lambda captures (by reference) the corresponding _s_, and the resulting closure object is assigned to _lambda1_.  When the call operator is invoked on _lambda1_, the captured reference to _s_ is used in the call.  The modified _s_ is then copied back to the host device on exit from the __target__ construct."

    "In CASE 2, a lambda expression is instead defined before the __target__ construct and captures (by copy) the pointer _sp_. A __target__ __data__ construct is used to first map the structure, and then the __target__ construct implicitly maps the closure object referenced by _lambda2_, a zero-length array section based on the structure pointer _sp_, and a zero-length array section based on the captured pointer in the closure object. The implicit maps result in attached pointers to the corresponding structure. The call for _lambda2_ inside the __target__ construct will access _sp->a_ and _sp->b_ from the corresponding structure."

    "CASE 3 is similar to CASE 2, except _s_ is instead captured by reference by the lambda expression. As for CASE 2, the structure is first mapped by an enclosing __target__ __data__ construct, and then the __target__ construct implicitly maps _s_ and the closure object referenced by _lambda3_. The effect of the map is to make the the call for _lambda3_ refer to the corresponding _s_ inside the __target__ construct rather than the original _s_."

    "In CASE 4, the program defines a static variable _ss_ of the same structure type as _s_. While the body of the lambda expression refers to _ss_, it is not captured. In order for _lambda4_ to be callable in the __target__ region, the reference to _ss_ should be to a device copy of _ss_ that also has static storage. This is achieved with the use of the __declare__ __target__ directive.  Inside the __target__ construct, all references to _ss_, including in the _lambda4()_ call, will refer to the corresponding _ss_ that results from the __declare__ __target__ directive. The __always__ modifier is used on the __map__ clause to transfer the updated values for the structure back to the host device."
