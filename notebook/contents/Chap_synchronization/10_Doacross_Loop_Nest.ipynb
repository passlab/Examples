    "An __ordered__ clause can be used on a loop construct with an integer parameter argument to define the number of associated loops within  a  _doacross loop nest_  where cross-iteration dependences exist.

The __doacross(source:omp_cur_iteration)__  or __doacross(source:)__ clause indicates  the completion of computation from the current iteration ( _i_ )  to satisfy the cross-iteration dependence that arises from the iteration. The __omp_cur_iteration__ keyword is optional for the __source__ dependence type. For this example the same sequential ordering could have been achieved  with an __ordered__ clause without a parameter, on the loop directive,  and a single __ordered__ directive without the __doacross__ clause specified for the statement executing the  _bar_  function."

Likewise, the __doacross(sink:j-1,i)__ and __doacross(sink:j,i-1)__ clauses  in the Fortran code define cross-iteration dependences from iterations  ( _j-1, i_ ) and ( _j, i-1_ ) to iteration ( _j, i_ )."
