There are three ways that a tool can provide a definition of __ompt_start_tool__ to an OpenMP implementation: (1) Statically linking the tool's definition of __ompt_start_tool__ into an OpenMP application. (2) Introducing a dynamically linked library that includes the tool's definition of __ompt_start_tool__ into the application's address space. (3) Providing the name of a dynamically linked library appropriate for the architecture and operating system used by the application in the  _tool-libraries-var_  ICV."

A tool can register callbacks for OpenMP events using the runtime entry point known as __ompt_set_callback__, which has the following possible return codes: \\hfill \break  __ompt_set_error__,  __ompt_set_never__,  __ompt_set_impossible__,  __ompt_set_sometimes__,  __ompt_set_sometimes_paired__,  __ompt_set_always__."

All callbacks registered with __ompt_set_callback__ or returned by __ompt_get_callback__ use the dummy type signature __ompt_callback_t__. While this is a compromise, it is better than providing unique runtime entry points with precise type signatures to set and get the callback for each unique runtime entry point type signature."
